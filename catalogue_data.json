The 110/100-19 has a unique tread pattern that will allow the tire to be used in sandy and muddy conditions but also will still perform in intermediate conditions. This tire helps get the holeshot but will still perform at a high level in multiple conditions. Optimal air pressure range is 13-14 psi.",
